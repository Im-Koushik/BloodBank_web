# DBMS_proj_blood_bank

The Main aim of Blood Bank Management Mini DBMS project is to ease the process of blood donation and allowance at blood bank. We aim to demonstrate the use of insert, select, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. This project starts by adding details of donors and patients.Blood donor can add his details with blood group, gender, address etc. Now, when patient is in need of blood, people(friends and relatives of patient) can easily check the blood group available and provide it to the blood receiver.
